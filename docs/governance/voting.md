## Voting Frequency and Cadence

Lift Cash introduces an unprecedented level of community control over monetary policy, ensuring that key economic parameters are managed democratically and adapt to evolving needs. This governance model combines user empowerment with robust mechanisms for maintaining stability and inclusivity.

### Voting Frequency

The Lift Cash community engages actively through regular voting opportunities in the dApp, with up to **three votes per week** on critical economic levers. These levers, often referred to as the **three key parameters**, play a vital role in shaping the token economy:

1. **Mint Fees:**  
   - Determines the cost of converting **PROMO** into **LIFT** tokens.  
   - Provides the ability to influence token supply indirectly by controlling the pace and incentive for PROMO-to-LIFT conversions.  
   - **Why It Matters:** Higher fees can dampen conversion activity, reducing token supply growth, while lower fees encourage more conversions, increasing the circulating supply.

2. **Issuance Rates:**  
   - Sets the rate at which new **LIFT tokens** are introduced into circulation.  
   - Controls the balance between reward distribution and inflation.  
   - **Why It Matters:** Adjusting issuance rates helps stabilise token value by aligning supply growth with user activity and demand, preventing excessive inflation.

3. **Locking Thresholds:**  
   - Establishes the ratio of locked vs. unlocked **PROMO rewards**.  
   - Incentivises long-term commitment while managing liquidity.  
   - **Why It Matters:** Locking more PROMO reduces immediate liquidity but fosters a more stable ecosystem by encouraging long-term staking and reducing sell pressure.

These weekly voting opportunities foster an active and engaged user base, ensuring that the ecosystem remains adaptive to both market dynamics and community priorities.

### Interplay of the Three Parameters

The three parameters are interconnected, forming a cohesive framework for economic control:

- **Mint Fees and Issuance Rates:** These work together to regulate token supply and inflation. Lower mint fees paired with higher issuance rates can stimulate rapid ecosystem growth, while higher fees and lower issuance rates stabilise supply.
- **Locking Thresholds and Mint Fees:** Locking thresholds impact the availability of PROMO for conversion. By adjusting mint fees in tandem, the community can fine-tune liquidity and ensure sustainable economic activity.
- **Dynamic Feedback Loop:** These levers enable real-time adjustments that reflect user sentiment, market demand, and the platform’s long-term goals.

### Adaptability

Lift Cash’s governance model empowers the community to rapidly adjust policies based on:
  
- **User Sentiment:** Feedback gathered through optional surveys ensures alignment with participant priorities.  
- **Market Demand:** Real-time data allows policies to be fine-tuned to meet ecosystem needs and ensure economic stability.  
- **Ecosystem Priorities:** Governance decisions evolve dynamically to address new challenges and opportunities as the platform grows.


## Decide ID Mechanics

To safeguard fairness and prevent manipulation, **Decide ID** is integrated into the governance framework. This **Proof-of-Personhood** system ensures:
  
- **One-Person–One-Vote:** Each participant represents a unique identity, eliminating Sybil attacks and ensuring equitable decision-making.  
- **Trusted Governance:** Verified participants create a secure, transparent environment for determining monetary policies.  

### How Decide ID Maintains Privacy

- **Liveness Checks:** Ensure participants are real, unique individuals through AI-powered facial recognition and motion detection.  
- **Selective Disclosure:** Protects user privacy by revealing only necessary identity information for verification.  
- **Decentralised Storage:** All identity data is stored securely across decentralised networks, minimising risks of breaches or misuse.  

### Integration with Voting

- **One-Person–One-Vote Governance:** Decide ID ensures each participant has an equal say, upholding democratic ideals.

By integrating Decide ID, Lift Cash upholds fairness, security, and privacy in its governance, setting a new standard for trust and inclusivity in decentralised finance.

### Sybil Resistance via Decide ID

A cornerstone of Lift Cash’s governance model is its robust approach to Sybil resistance, achieved through the integration of **Decide ID**. This advanced identity verification system ensures that governance remains equitable, secure, and tamper-proof.

### Proof-of-Personhood

Decide ID employs cutting-edge technology to verify the uniqueness of each participant:

- **AI-Driven Verification**: Utilises advanced facial recognition and motion-based liveness detection to confirm that each account represents a real, unique individual.
- **Fraud Prevention**: Ensures that bots, duplicate accounts, and other fraudulent identities cannot manipulate governance decisions or distort participation.
- **Dynamic Checks**: Periodic re-verification ensures ongoing compliance with identity uniqueness while adapting to user activity.

### Privacy Preservation

While maintaining robust identity verification, Decide ID prioritises user privacy through a combination of secure design principles:

- **Selective Disclosure**: Users can prove their uniqueness without revealing sensitive personal information, maintaining anonymity where possible.
- **AI-Optimised Data Security**: Verification processes are anonymised and encrypted, ensuring that data used for verification is inaccessible to external parties.
- **Decentralised Data Storage**: All identity data is encrypted and distributed across decentralised networks, minimising risks of breaches or unauthorised access.
- **No Central Authority**: The decentralised verification process ensures that no single entity has control over user identities or governance participation.

### Maintaining Governance Integrity

Decide ID ensures that Lift Cash’s governance processes are fair, secure, and resistant to exploitation:

- **Prevents Sybil Attacks**: Eliminates manipulation by bots or bad actors using multiple accounts, preserving the integrity of governance votes.
- **Promotes Trust and Transparency**: A publicly auditable yet privacy-focused process builds confidence among participants and fosters a more engaged community.
- **Equal Participation**: Unique identity verification guarantees a one-person–one-vote system, upholding democratic ideals and ensuring equitable representation.

### Why It Matters

- **Policy Evaluation:** Surveys allow users to express their opinions on existing policies, such as mint fees, issuance rates, and locking thresholds.  
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Gauges community sentiment on emerging issues, providing a qualitative layer of data to complement quantitative governance metrics.  
- **Accessibility:** Surveys are straightforward and seamlessly embedded into the dApp, ensuring ease of participation for all users.

By encouraging regular feedback, the platform ensures that governance decisions are informed by a holistic understanding of user priorities.

### Flexibility and Responsiveness
