# Governance: Democratic Monetary Policy and DAO

Lift Cash is built on the principle of democratic governance, ensuring that the community collectively shapes the platform’s direction. The governance framework empowers users to actively participate in decision-making, ensuring transparency, inclusivity, and long-term alignment with the community’s goals.

## The Lift Cash DAO

At the heart of Lift Cash’s governance model is the **Lift Cash DAO**, powered by the **Service Nervous System (SNS)** framework. This innovative approach decentralises control and fosters active community participation.

### Community Ownership and Sustainability  
The Lift Cash DAO ensures that governance is fully decentralised, putting critical decision-making power in the hands of the participants:
  
- **Ownership Through Stakeholding:** Users who stake **LIFT tokens** gain voting rights, empowering them to influence platform policies and shape its evolution.  
- **Aligned Incentives:** Governance decisions are made collectively, aligning individual and collective interests to create a sustainable and equitable system.  

### Governance Roles 
The Lift Cash DAO is structured to facilitate seamless and transparent governance through clearly defined roles and processes:
  
- **Proposal Submission:**  
   - Any community member with staked LIFT tokens can propose changes, from tokenomics adjustments to treasury allocations or platform enhancements.  
   - **Treasury Allocation:** Approving grants, partnerships, and strategic investments to drive ecosystem growth.  
   - **Platform Enhancements:** Suggesting and voting on technical updates or new feature integrations.  

   
- **Voting Mechanism:**  
    - Voting weight is proportional to the amount of **LIFT tokens staked**, incentivising active participation and long-term commitment to the ecosystem.  
   - Proposals are evaluated through transparent on-chain votes, ensuring accountability and visibility of all outcomes. 

## The Lift Cash DAPP
 
The Lift Cash DAPP (Decentralised Appliation) is where the economic policy is voted upon. This is open to any users, as long as they verify they are unique individuals through Decide ID. Unlike the DAO, participants do not need to stake LIFT to participate and earn.

Through the voting on the economic policy, verified participants can earn PROMO, a non-transferable point-like token through their votes, essentially working as economic stewards.  PROMO can be used to mint LIFT as long as the conditions are meant.

### Empowered Decision-Making
The DAPP is the decentralised application for Lift Cash that provides a framework for users to directly influence key aspects of the platform, primarily:
  
- **Monetary Policy:** Setting mint fees, issuance rates, and thresholds for PROMO rewards.  

The Lift Cash DAPP establishes a robust foundation for community-driven governance. This ensures the platform remains adaptable, transparent, and aligned with the collective vision of its users.
