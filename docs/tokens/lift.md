##  LIFT: Utility and Governance Token

**LIFT tokens** are the primary currency of the Lift Cash ecosystem, providing both governance capabilities and monetary utility. They are minted exclusively from PROMO tokens, ensuring that LIFT represents a fair and sustainable reward for active contribution.

### Key Features:
- **Governance Rights:**  
  - LIFT holders can propose and vote on key DAO decisions, including monetary policies, treasury allocations, and ecosystem updates.  
  - Staked LIFT tokens amplify voting power, incentivising long-term commitment to the ecosystem.  
- **Economic Exchange:** LIFT functions as the medium of exchange within the ecosystem, facilitating transactions and acting as a unit of value.  
- **Staking Opportunities:** Staking LIFT tokens allows users to earn additional rewards, fostering engagement and reinforcing the ecosystem’s stability.  

### Minting LIFT:
- **Conversion Mechanism:** PROMO tokens are converted into LIFT via a minting process governed by DAO-determined mint fees.  
- **Supply Management:** The DAO adjusts issuance rates and minting parameters to maintain a balance between token supply and ecosystem demand.  

## Mint Fees and Baseline Utility

To establish a baseline demand for LIFT tokens, **mint fees** are required during the conversion of PROMO to LIFT. This mechanism ensures that LIFT tokens maintain intrinsic value within the ecosystem.

### Why Mint Fees Exist:
- **Baseline Utility:** Similar to taxes in fiat systems, mint fees create a foundational demand for LIFT tokens by making them a prerequisite for token conversion.
- **Economic Stability:** Fees discourage frivolous or excessive token conversions, aligning supply growth with genuine ecosystem demand.

### Community Oversight:
- **Adjustable Fees:** The DAO governs mint fee rates, ensuring they adapt to changing market conditions and community priorities.
- **Revenue Allocation:** Fees collected through minting can be reinvested into the ecosystem via treasury grants, liquidity pools, or other initiatives that foster growth.

By integrating mint fees into the tokenomics, Lift Cash ensures that LIFT tokens remain economically sustainable and tied to productive activities within the ecosystem.

## Synergistic Relationship Between PROMO and LIFT

The dual-token system ensures that Lift Cash remains sustainable and user-driven:
  
- **Participation-Driven Supply:** The creation of LIFT is inherently tied to active community engagement, fostering inclusivity and reducing speculative influences.  
- **Governance Alignment:** The PROMO-to-LIFT pathway creates a direct link between ecosystem contributions and governance rights, ensuring that decision-making power reflects genuine involvement.  
- **Economic Flexibility:** By dynamically adjusting mint fees, issuance rates, and locking thresholds, the DAO can adapt to changing market conditions and community needs.  

This dual-token model exemplifies Lift Cash’s commitment to creating a cooperative financial ecosystem that rewards meaningful participation while empowering users to shape the platform’s future.
