# Token System

Lift Cashâ€™s tokenomics are carefully designed to balance user incentives, sustainability, and community-driven governance. At the heart of this system lies a **dual-token model** that distinguishes between contribution-based earning (PROMO) and utility-based functionality (LIFT). This approach ensures that participation is rewarded meaningfully while fostering a robust, adaptable economic framework.


## PROMO: Contribution-Based Rewards

**PROMO tokens** represent active engagement within the Lift Cash ecosystem. They are earned through meaningful contributions such as governance participation, voting on monetary policies, or completing surveys. PROMO serves as a precursor to LIFT, linking token creation directly to user involvement.

### Key Features:
- **Non-Transferable:** PROMO tokens cannot be traded or exchanged, ensuring their value is derived solely from ecosystem contributions.
- **Locked vs. Unlocked PROMO:**  
  - **Locked PROMO:** Tokens subject to a mandatory locking period, determined by DAO governance, to encourage long-term engagement and prevent oversupply.  
  - **Unlocked PROMO:** Tokens eligible for conversion into LIFT, becoming immediately usable for governance and utility.  
  - **Governance Thresholds:** The ratio of locked to unlocked PROMO is a parameter determined by community votes, maintaining balance and economic sustainability.

| **PROMO Type**     | **Purpose**                                      | **Eligibility**                                   | **Impact**                                                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Locked PROMO**    | Incentivizes long-term ecosystem participation. | Locked for a fixed period (set by governance).   | Supports economic stability by preventing immediate oversupply.           |
| **Unlocked PROMO**  | Becomes eligible for conversion into LIFT tokens. | Earned through participation, ready for conversion. | Encourages active engagement while linking to immediate token utility.    |

## Earning PROMO:
- **Participation Rewards:** PROMO tokens are awarded for completing governance-related activities, such as voting, surveys, and policy adjustments.
- **Monetary Policy Impact:** PROMO issuance rates are periodically reviewed and adjusted by the DAO to align incentives with ecosystem goals.
