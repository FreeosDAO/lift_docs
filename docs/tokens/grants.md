Lift Cash extends its commitment to economic empowerment by leveraging its SNS DAO Treasury to fund initiatives that foster real-world utility and sustainable growth. By allocating resources to productive ventures, the platform creates tangible demand for LIFT tokens, aligning with the principles of sustainable capital allocation.

## SNS DAO Treasury
- **Funding Innovative Teams:**  
  The SNS DAO Treasury supports developers and organisations building goods and services that integrate LIFT tokens. These initiatives not only expand the ecosystem but also drive genuine demand for the currency.
  
- **Boosting Ecosystem Utility:**  
  Grants are awarded to projects that create meaningful applications, ensuring LIFT tokens play a central role in driving real-world value and adoption.



## Microloans
*(Potential Future Feature)*

Lift Cash envisions **microloans** as a potential feature for empowering community-driven economic activity. This proposal involves using locked PROMO tokens as collateral to create a cooperative lending mechanism. Since this feature would be introduced after the SNS launch, it requires community agreement and approval through DAO governance before development and integration.

### How Microloans Might Work: Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Loan Request:**  
   - A project or individual submits a loan request to the SNS DAO, detailing the purpose, expected outcomes, and repayment terms.
   
2. **Community Collateral Pledging:**  
   - Users pledge their locked PROMO tokens as collateral, demonstrating confidence in the borrower and aligning interests across the ecosystem.
   
3. **Loan Approval:**  
   - The SNS DAO evaluates the request based on pledged collateral and multiplies or approves the loan amount if collateral coverage meets predefined thresholds.
   
4. **Loan Disbursement:**  
   - Funds are disbursed in LIFT tokens or another supported asset, allowing the borrower to utilise resources for their intended purpose.
   
5. **Repayment and Collateral Release:**  
   - The borrower repays the loan in agreed instalments or by a specified deadline. Once repayment is complete, the collateral is unlocked and returned to the pledgers.

### Community Agreement and Governance
- **Post-SNS Launch:**  
  - Microloans will only be developed and integrated if the community approves the proposal through a governance vote in the SNS DAO.
  - This ensures that the feature aligns with the collective priorities and vision of the Lift Cash ecosystem.
  
- **Flexible Policy Development:**  
  - The community can shape the implementation of microloans, including collateral requirements, repayment terms, and rewards for pledgers.

### Potential Rewards for Collateral Participants
- **Incentives for Pledging:**  
  - Participants who pledge PROMO tokens as collateral may earn interest on the loan or receive additional rewards in the form of LIFT tokens.
  - These incentives encourage active involvement in the lending process and foster community collaboration.

#### **Risk Mitigation**
- The use of locked PROMO tokens ensures that loans are backed by tangible value, reducing the risk of defaults.
- DAO oversight provides ongoing monitoring and adjustments to lending policies, ensuring alignment with ecosystem needs.


### Productive Capital Allocation: Werner’s Principle
Lift Cash’s potential microloans feature aligns with **Professor Richard Werner’s principle** of directing capital toward productive uses, fostering genuine economic growth and sustainability.

### **Key Applications**
1. **Supporting Innovation:**  
   - Microloans could empower individuals and small teams to develop projects that contribute tangible goods and services to the ecosystem.
   
2. **Stimulating Demand for LIFT Tokens:**  
   - Loan-funded projects would likely utilise LIFT tokens in their operations, driving organic demand and enhancing token utility.
   
3. **Balancing Risk and Growth:**  
   - By requiring community collateral and implementing DAO oversight, the system would ensure responsible lending practices that balance growth with financial stability.


### Building a Cooperative Future
The microloans proposal, if implemented, would exemplify Lift Cash’s commitment to inclusivity and empowerment by fostering a resilient, community-driven ecosystem.

- **Real-World Impact:**  
  Each funded loan would contribute to a thriving ecosystem, promoting innovation and the adoption of LIFT tokens.

- **Community Trust:**  
  Transparent processes, combined with the security of community-collateralised loans, would foster confidence in the platform’s governance and economic model.

- **Aligned Incentives:**  
  Through microloans and rewards for collateral pledgers, Lift Cash could create a dynamic system where all participants benefit from mutual collaboration and shared success.

*Note:* As a potential future feature, the implementation of microloans is contingent upon community approval, ensuring alignment with Lift Cash’s collective vision and goals.
