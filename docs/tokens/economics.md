### Vesting Schedules

- **Team and Advisors**: Subject to a **three-year vesting period** with a **12-month cliff** to ensure incentives align with long-term ecosystem growth. 
- **SNS Tokens**: Distributed as **staked neurons**, following structured dissolve delays to ensure gradual release of tokens into the circulating supply. 
- **Investor Tokens**: Allocated as staked neurons with dissolve delays to ensure alignment with long-term project goals.

### Dynamic Supply Mechanics

Lift Cash incorporates a balanced approach to managing token supply, ensuring long-term economic stability while incentivising active ecosystem participation.

##### **Inflationary Measures**:
- **Staking Rewards**: New tokens are minted to reward users who stake LIFT tokens and actively participate in governance.
- **Community Growth**: Newly minted tokens incentivise early adopters and contributors, fostering ecosystem expansion.

##### **Deflationary Measures**:
- **Mint Fee Burns**: A percentage of fees collected during the minting of LIFT tokens from PROMO is burned, reducing the circulating supply.
- **Transaction Burns**: Certain ecosystem transactions include a burn mechanism to decrease token supply over time.

##### **Dynamic Adjustments**:
Governance participants can influence minting fees, burn rates, and inflation targets to ensure tokenomics remain aligned with the platform’s needs and market conditions.

### Treasury Management

The DAO treasury plays a pivotal role in sustaining the Lift Cash ecosystem. Its key functions include:

1. **Incentives and Rewards**:
   - Allocating funds for governance participation and ecosystem contributions.
2. **Development and Innovation**:
   - Supporting developers building applications that integrate LIFT tokens.
3. **Marketing and Partnerships**:
   - Promoting the Lift Cash ecosystem and establishing strategic collaborations.
4. **Liquidity Management**:
   - Ensuring liquidity for smooth trading and minimising token volatility.

All treasury transactions are governed through DAO voting and transparently recorded on-chain.


### Staking Mechanism

Lift Cash’s staking model encourages long-term commitment while promoting active participation in governance.

#### **Key Features**:
1. **Flexible Dissolve Delays**:
   - Users choose staking periods ranging from short-term (1 month) to long-term (up to 8 years).
   - Longer dissolve delays yield higher staking rewards and governance power.
2. **Graduated Rewards**:
   - Reward tiers scale with staking duration, incentivising users to commit to the ecosystem’s growth.
3. **Governance Participation**:
   - Long-term stakers gain proportionally higher voting power, ensuring decisions align with dedicated participants.

By fostering long-term engagement and reducing circulating supply, the staggered staking mechanism bolsters ecosystem resilience and stability.

## Adaptive Supply Controls

The Lift Cash ecosystem employs **adaptive supply controls** to maintain economic stability and align token distribution with real-time demand. These mechanisms ensure that LIFT token supply remains balanced, protecting its value while incentivising sustainable growth.


### Supply Locking vs. Supply Release

Lift Cash uses dynamic mechanisms to balance token supply based on demand, ensuring stability and value preservation.

### Supply Locking

- **Purpose:** Prevent oversupply and devaluation of LIFT tokens during periods of low demand.
- **Trigger Conditions:**
  - If the market demand for LIFT tokens dips below a predefined threshold (e.g., price, trading volume), the system automatically locks the conversion of PROMO into LIFT.
  - Governance may adjust these thresholds to reflect changing market conditions.
- **Effects:**
  - Limits new LIFT token issuance, preserving value and preventing inflationary pressures.
  - Encourages users to stake and hold LIFT tokens, fostering long-term ecosystem stability.

### Supply Release
- **Purpose:** Match token supply with increasing demand to stabilise prices and prevent scarcity.
- **Trigger Conditions:**
  - If demand for LIFT tokens surpasses a predefined metric (e.g., price growth, ecosystem activity), PROMO tokens are unlocked for conversion into LIFT.
  - The DAO governs the thresholds and release rate to ensure controlled minting.
- **Effects:**
  - Ensures token supply meets market demand, supporting price stability.
  - Facilitates ecosystem growth by enabling new participants to mint LIFT tokens.


#### **Illustrative Example**
- **Scenario 1: Low Demand**
  - Market demand for LIFT tokens drops below 70% of its historical moving average.
  - **Action:** PROMO-to-LIFT conversions are paused, preserving the current supply and stabilising token value.
  - **Result:** Inflationary pressures are mitigated, encouraging holders to stake or engage in governance.
- **Scenario 2: High Demand**
  - LIFT token price surpasses a growth threshold of 15% over the past 30 days.
  - **Action:** PROMO tokens are unlocked, allowing users to mint new LIFT tokens.
  - **Result:** New supply accommodates market demand, avoiding excessive price surges or scarcity.


## Productive Capital Allocation

Lift Cash’s adaptive supply controls are inspired by **Professor Richard Werner’s principle**, emphasising the importance of funding productive ventures to drive sustainable growth.

### **Key Applications**
1. **Real Demand Creation:** Treasury funds are allocated to projects that deliver tangible goods and services, generating organic demand for LIFT tokens.
2. **Feedback Loop:** Increased demand elevates token value, triggering controlled PROMO unlocking and further economic activity.
3. **Community-Driven Adjustments:** Governance mechanisms ensure supply adjustments align with the ecosystem’s priorities and market conditions.

## Sustainability in Action
Adaptive supply controls are fundamental to Lift Cash’s sustainable economic model. They ensure:
- **Token Value Protection:** During periods of low activity, supply adjustments prevent devaluation and maintain market confidence.
- **Ecosystem Growth:** During high demand, controlled minting supports ecosystem expansion without compromising token stability.
- **Long-Term Resilience:** By aligning incentives with real demand, Lift Cash fosters a self-sustaining, adaptable ecosystem that evolves with its community.

This approach positions Lift Cash as a dynamic, user-driven platform that balances immediate needs with long-term growth and stability.

## Incentivised Long-Term Commitment

Lift Cash incentivises active participation and long-term engagement through a robust staking mechanism. By aligning rewards with user commitment, the ecosystem fosters stability, reduces volatility, and ensures that governance remains in the hands of dedicated participants.

### SNS DAO Staking
- **Enhanced Voting Power:**  
  LIFT tokens staked in the SNS DAO are locked into neurons, granting holders increased voting power. This ensures that those who commit to the platform have a greater influence on governance decisions.

- **Additional Rewards:**  
  Stakers earn periodic rewards for their contribution to the ecosystem’s stability and governance. Rewards are distributed in LIFT tokens, creating a mutually beneficial loop that reinforces participation.

### Vesting Schedules & Staggered Staking
- **Encouraging Long-Term Ownership:**  
  Lift Cash incorporates vesting schedules and staggered staking mechanisms, where tokens unlock over time. This approach mirrors traditional vesting schedules while leveraging blockchain’s transparency and security.

- **Reducing Market Volatility:**  
  Staggered staking ensures that tokens are gradually released into circulation, minimising sudden market shocks caused by large unlock events.

- **Fostering Ecosystem Resilience:**  
  By tying staking rewards to long-term commitment, participants are incentivised to prioritise the ecosystem’s success over short-term gains.

### Aligning Incentives for Long-Term Success
- **Mutual Benefit:**  
  Staking aligns individual rewards with the collective health of the ecosystem. As users commit to governance and the platform’s stability, they actively contribute to its growth and sustainability.

- **Strengthening Community Ownership:**  
  Staked neurons encourage users to engage in governance and economic decisions, reinforcing the principle of community-driven control.

- **Securing the Future of Lift Cash:**  
  Long-term staking creates a robust foundation for ecosystem development, ensuring that Lift Cash can adapt and thrive while retaining its core values of inclusivity, transparency, and empowerment.

### Sustainability Through Commitment
The staking system balances immediate rewards with long-term stability, creating a secure and dynamic financial model. By rewarding commitment and active participation, Lift Cash ensures that its ecosystem remains vibrant, community-focused, and positioned for enduring success.
